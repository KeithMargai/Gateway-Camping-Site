        <h2>About Gateway Camping Site</h2>
        <p>Gateway Camping Park is a brand new camping site located in Forest Park, GA. The camping site started development in 2021 and completed in January of 2023. We are currently constructing more sites around California, New York and some parts of the Midwest.  This camping site was built to help others tap into a new way of fun instead of the typical going out shopping or playing video games. Gateway was inspired by travelling to states like Oregon and Vermont. While travelling the forests & mountains, we gained a sense of relief, all our responsibilites being washed away for a short period of time. Me & my team had an idea to create sites to many others can experience that feeling too. Gateway Camping Site is a great way to be more engaged and offers many activities like canoeing, hiking, fishing, etc. This is a reserved location, and you can book a placement on our Contacts page. We look forward to your arrival!</p>
